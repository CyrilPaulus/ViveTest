# ViveTest

[![ViveTest](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kvyIMBz5v7U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvyIMBz5v7U "ViveTest")

ViveTest is a simple game made in a few hours using Unity, SteamVR and the HTC Vive.
The goal of this game was to see how simple it would be to make a basic "Jenga" game.

## How to play

There are no objectives in the game, juste launch it and put your headset on.
There is a button that you can touch to spawn more pieces.

The controllers have 3 modes :

* Push mode (default) : Push objects with the little green orb attached to the controller.
* Pull mode (toggle with grip button) : Place the transparent orb on a object and pull the trigger to grab an object. The object will still collide with other pieces.
* Delete mode (push the touchpad) : Every object within the blue orb will be deleted.

## Release

If you don't want to build the game yourself and want to try it right away, you should find a Windows build in the [release section](https://github.com/CyrilPaulus/ViveTest/releases) of this GitHub.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Sean Lee](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvsXZOdBkr3fvW8Amt4pXRg) for his [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTctk19sx8&index=3&list=PLLEJeNmmpJEefm06P7q-r9lNmVzleGYaX) on how to use the HTC Vive in Unity and interact with physical objects.

Feel free to use any of the code you can find in this projec
